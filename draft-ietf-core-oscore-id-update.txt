                      Identifier Update for OSCORE
                draft-ietf-core-oscore-id-update-latest

Abstract

   Two peers that communicate with the CoAP protocol can use the Object
   Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) protocol to
   protect their message exchanges end-to-end.  To this end, the two
   peers share an OSCORE Security Context and a number of related
   identifiers.  In particular, each of the two peers stores a Sender ID
   that identifies its own Sender Context within the Security Context,
   and a Recipient ID that identifies the Recipient Context associated
   with the other peer within the same Security Context.  These
   identifiers are sent in plaintext within OSCORE-protected messages.
   Hence, they can be used to correlate messages exchanged between peers
   and track those peers, with consequent privacy implications.  This
   document defines an ID update procedure that two peers can use to
   update their OSCORE identifiers.  This procedure can be run
   independently or embedded in an execution of the Key Update for
   OSCORE (KUDOS) procedure.

1.  Introduction

   OSCORE [RFC8613] peers protect messages to send using the Sender
   Context and verify messages received using the Recipient Context.
   The contexts include information a peer needs to protect or unprotect
   an OSCORE message.  To identify a specific context to use,
   identifiers are used in the form of a Sender ID and a Recipient ID.
   These identifiers are included in the OSCORE option to provide
   information to the other peer about what OSCORE Recipient Context to
   use to unprotect an incoming message.

   Since these identifiers are sent as cleartext over the wire, an
   adversary can use these to correlate communication flows between
   peers.  Even in the case when peers change networks or other
   addressing information, the identifiers may still be possible to use
   to understand that observed communication is between these same two
   peers.

   A way to mitigate this problem is to allow OSCORE peers to update
   their identifiers.  This document introduces such a procedure,
   allowing two peers to execute a message exchange which results in
   updated identifiers, and thus continued communication with new Sender
   and Recipient IDs.  This results in privacy benefits, as it helps
   mitigate the ability of an adversary to correlate the two peers'
   communication between two points in time or between paths.  For
   instance, two peers may want to use this procedure before switching
   to a different network for their communication, in order to make it
   more difficult to understand that the continued communication over
   the new network is taking place between the same two peers.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CoAP [RFC7252], Observe [RFC7641], CBOR [RFC8949], OSCORE
   [RFC8613], and KUDOS [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update].

   This document additionally defines the following terminology.

   *  Initiator: the peer starting the ID update procedure, by sending
      the first message.

   *  Responder: the peer that receives the first message in an
      execution of the ID update procedure.

   *  Forward message flow: the execution workflow where the initiator
      acts as CoAP client (see Section 2.1.1).

   *  Reverse message flow: the execution workflow where the initiator
      acts as CoAP server (see Section 2.1.2).

2.  Update of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs

   This section defines the procedure that two peers can perform, in
   order to update the OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that they use in
   their shared OSCORE Security Context.

   When performing an update of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, a peer
   provides its new intended OSCORE Recipient ID to the other peer, by
   means of the Recipient-ID Option defined in Section 2.1.  Hereafter,
   this document refers to a message including the Recipient-ID Option
   as an "OSCORE IDs update (request/response) message".

   This procedure can be initiated by either peer, i.e., the CoAP client
   or the CoAP server may start it by sending the first OSCORE IDs
   update message.  The former case is denoted as the "forward message
   flow" and the latter as the "reverse message flow".

   Furthermore, this procedure can be executed stand-alone, or instead
   seamlessly integrated in an execution of the KUDOS procedure for
   updating OSCORE keying material (see Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]) using its FS mode or no-FS mode
   (see Section 4.5 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]).

   *  In the former stand-alone case, updating the OSCORE Sender/
      Recipient IDs effectively results in updating part of the current
      OSCORE Security Context.

      That is, both peers derive a new Sender Key, Recipient Key, and
      Common IV, as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC8613].  Also, both
      peer re-initialize the Sender Sequence Number and the Replay
      Window accordingly, as defined in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613].
      Since the same Master Secret is preserved, forward secrecy is not
      achieved.

      As defined in Section 2.1.3, the two peers must take additional
      actions to ensure a safe execution of the OSCORE IDs update
      procedure.

      A peer can safely discard the old OSCORE Security Context
      including the old Sender/Recipient IDs after the following two
      events have occurred, in this order: first, the peer has sent to
      the other peer a message protected with the new OSCORE Security
      Context including the new Sender/Recipient IDs; then, the peer has
      received from the other peer and successfully verified a message
      protected with that new OSCORE Security Context.

   *  In the latter integrated case, the KUDOS initiator (responder)
      also acts as initiator (responder) for the OSCORE IDs update
      procedure.  That is, both KUDOS and the OSCORE IDs update
      procedure MUST be run either in their forward message flow or in
      their reverse message flow.

      The new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs MUST NOT be used with the
      OSCORE Security Context CTX_OLD, and MUST NOT be used with the
      temporary OSCORE Security Context used to protect the first KUDOS
      message of a KUDOS execution.

      The first use of the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs with the new
      OSCORE Security Context CTX_NEW occurs: for the KUDOS initiator,
      after having received from the KUDOS responder and successfully
      verified the second KUDOS message of the KUDOS execution in
      question; for the KUDOS responder, after having sent to the KUDOS
      initiator the second KUDOS message of the KUDOS execution in
      question.

   An initiator terminates an ongoing OSCORE IDs procedure with another
   peer as failed, in case, after having sent the first OSCORE IDs
   update message for the procedure in question, a pre-defined amount of
   time has elapsed without receiving and successfully verifying the
   second OSCORE IDs update message from the other peer.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that such an amount of time is equal to MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT
   (see Section 4.8.2 of [RFC7252]).

   A peer terminates an ongoing OSCORE IDs procedure with another peer
   as successful, in any of the following two cases.

   *  The peer is acting as initiator, and it has received and
      successfully verified the second OSCORE IDs update message from
      the other peer.

   *  The peer is acting as responder, and it has sent the second OSCORE
      IDs update message to the other peer.

   A peer MUST NOT initiate an OSCORE IDs procedure with another peer,
   if it has another such procedure ongoing with that other peer.

   Upon receiving a valid OSCORE IDs update message, a responder that
   supports the OSCORE IDs update procedure MUST send the second OSCORE
   IDs update message, except in the following case.

   *  The received OSCORE IDs update messages is not a KUDOS message
      (i.e., the OSCORE IDs update procedure is being performed stand-
      alone) and the responder has no eligible Recipient ID to offer to
      the initiator (see Section 2.1.3).

      If the responder is a server, the responder MUST also reply to the
      received OSCORE IDs update request message with a protected 5.03
      (Service Unavailable) error response.  The error response MUST NOT
      include the Recipient-ID Option, and its diagnostic payload MAY
      provide additional information.

      When receiving the error response, the initiator terminates the
      OSCORE IDs procedure as failed.

2.1.  The Recipient-ID Option

   The Recipient ID-Option defined in this section has the properties
   summarized in Figure 1, which extends Table 4 of [RFC7252].  That is,
   the option is elective, safe to forward, part of the cache key, and
   non repeatable.

   +-------+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | No.   | C | U | N | R | Name         | Format | Length | Default |
   +-------+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+
   |       |   |   |   |   |              |        |        |         |
   | TBD24 |   |   |   |   | Recipient-ID | opaque | any    | (none)  |
   |       |   |   |   |   |              |        |        |         |
   +-------+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+
             C=Critical, U=Unsafe, N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable

                     Figure 1: The Recipient-ID Option.

   Note to RFC Editor: Following the registration of the CoAP Option
   Number 24, please replace "TBD24" with "24" in the figure above.
   Then, please delete this paragraph.

   The option value can have an arbitrary length.  Implementations can
   limit its length to that of the longest supported Recipient ID.

   This document particularly defines how this option is used in
   messages protected with OSCORE.  That is, when the option is included
   in an outgoing message, the option value specifies the new OSCORE
   Recipient ID that the sender endpoint intends to use with the other
   endpoint sharing the OSCORE Security Context.

   Therefore, the maximum lenght of the option value is equal to the
   maximum lenght of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs.  As defined in
   Section 3.3 of [RFC8613], this is determined by the size of the AEAD
   nonce of the used AEAD Algorithm in the OSCORE Security Context.

   The Recipient-ID Option is of class E in terms of OSCORE processing
   (see Section 4.1 of [RFC8613]).

2.1.1.  Forward Message Flow

   Figure 2 shows an example of the OSCORE IDs update procedure, run
   stand-alone and in the forward message flow, with the client acting
   as initiator.  On each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID
   and Recipient ID of that peer, respectively.

   Appendix A.1 provides a different example of the OSCORE IDs update
   procedure, as run integrated in an execution of KUDOS and in the
   forward message flow (see Section 4.3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]).

      Figure 2: Example of the OSCORE IDs Update forward message flow

   Before the OSCORE IDs update procedure starts, the client (the
   server) shares with the server (the client) an OSCORE Security
   Context CTX_A with Sender ID 0x01 (0x00) and Recipient ID 0x00
   (0x01).

   When starting the OSCORE IDs update procedure, the client determines
   its new intended OSCORE Recipient ID 0x42.  Then, the client prepares
   a CoAP request targeting an application resource at the server.  The
   request includes the Recipient-ID Option, with value the client's new
   Recipient ID 0x42.

   The client protects the request with CTX_A, i.e., by using the keying
   material derived from the current client's Sender ID 0x01.  The
   protected request specifies the client's current Sender ID 0x01 in
   the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.  After that, the client sends
   the request to the server as Request #1.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Request #1, the server retrieves the value 0x42 from the
   Recipient-ID Option, and determines its new intended OSCORE Recipient
   ID 0x78.  Then, the server prepares a CoAP response including the
   Recipient-ID Option, with value the server's new Recipient ID 0x78.

   The server protects the response with CTX_A, i.e., by using the
   keying material derived from the current server's Sender ID 0x00.
   After that, the server sends the response to the client.

   Then, the server considers 0x42 and 0x78 as its new Sender ID and
   Recipient ID to use with the client, respectively.  As shown in the
   example, the server practically installs a new OSCORE Security
   Context CTX_B where: i) its Sender ID and Recipient ID are 0x42 and
   0x78, respectively; ii) the Sender Sequence Number and the Replay
   Window are re-initialized (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]); iii)
   anything else is like in the OSCORE Security Context used to encrypt
   the OSCORE message Response #1.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Response #1, the client considers 0x78 and 0x42 as the new
   Sender ID and Recipient ID to use with the server, respectively.  As
   shown in the example, the client practically installs a new OSCORE
   Security Context CTX_B where: i) its Sender ID and Recipient ID are
   0x78 and 0x42, respectively; ii) the Sender Sequence Number and the
   Replay Window are re-initialized (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]);
   iii) anything else is like in the OSCORE Security Context used to
   decrypt the OSCORE message Response #1.

   From then on, the client and the server can exchange messages
   protected with the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B, i.e., according to
   the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs and using new keying material
   derived from those.

   That is, the client sends the OSCORE message Request #2, which is
   protected with CTX_B and specifies the new client's Sender ID 0x78 in
   the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.

   Upon receiving the OSCORE message Request #2, the server retrieves
   the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B, according to its new Recipient ID
   0x78 specified in the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.  Then, the
   server decrypts and verifies the response by using CTX_B.  Finally,
   the server prepares a CoAP response Response #2, protects it with
   CTX_B, and sends it to the client.

   Upon receiving the OSCORE message Response #2, the client decrypts
   and verifies it with the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B.  In case of
   successfull verification, the client confirms that the server is
   aligned with the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, and thus discards
   the OSCORE Security Context CTX_A.

   After that, one further exchange occurs, where both the CoAP request
   and the CoAP response are protected with the OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_B.  In particular, upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully
   verifying the OSCORE message Request #3, the server confirms that the
   client is aligned with the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, and thus
   discards the OSCORE Security Context CTX_A.

2.1.2.  Reverse Message Flow

   Figure 3 shows an example of the OSCORE IDs update procedure, run
   stand-alone and in the reverse message flow, with the server acting
   as initiator.  On each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID
   and Recipient ID of that peer, respectively.

   Appendix A.2 provides a different example of the OSCORE IDs update
   procedure, as run integrated in an execution of KUDOS and in the
   reverse message flow (see Section 4.3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]).

      Figure 3: Example of the OSCORE IDs Update reverse message flow

   Before the OSCORE IDs update procedure starts, the client (the
   server) shares with the server (the client) an OSCORE Security
   Context CTX_A with Sender ID 0x01 (0x00) and Recipient ID 0x00
   (0x01).

   At first, the client prepares a CoAP Request #1 targeting an
   application resource at the server.  The client protects the request
   with CTX_A, i.e., by using the keying material derived from the
   current client's Sender ID 0x01.  The protected request specifies the
   client's current Sender ID 0x01 in the 'kid' field of the OSCORE
   Option.  After that, the client sends the request to the server as
   Request #1.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Request #1, the server decides to start an OSCORE IDs update
   procedure.  To this end, the server determines its new intended
   OSCORE Recipient ID 0x78.  Then, the server prepares a CoAP response
   as a reply to the just received request and including the Recipient-
   ID Option, with value the server's new Recipient ID 0x78.

   The server protects the response with CTX_A, i.e., by using the
   keying material derived from the current server's Sender ID 0x00.
   After that, the server sends the response to the client as Response
   #1.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Response #1, the client retrieves the value 0x78 from the
   Recipient-ID Option, and determines its new intended OSCORE Recipient
   ID 0x42.  Then, the client prepares a CoAP request targeting an
   application resource at the server.  The request includes the
   Recipient-ID Option, with value the client's new Recipient ID 0x42.

   The client protects the request with CTX_A, i.e., by using the keying
   material derived from the current client's Sender ID 0x01.  The
   protected request specifies the client's current Sender ID 0x01 in
   the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.  After that, the client sends
   the request to the server as Request #2.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Request #2, the server retrieves the value 0x42 from the
   Recipient-ID Option.  Then the server considers 0x42 and 0x78 as the
   new Sender ID and Recipient ID to use with the client, respectively.
   As shown in the example, the server practically installs a new OSCORE
   Security Context CTX_B where: i) its Sender ID and Recipient ID are
   0x42 and 0x78, respectively; ii) the Sender Sequence Number and the
   Replay Window are re-initialized (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]);
   iii) anything else is like in the OSCORE Security Context used to
   encrypt the OSCORE message Request #2.

   Then, the server prepares a CoAP response, as a reply to the just
   received request, and protects it with CTX_A, i.e., by using the
   keying material derived from the current server's Sender ID 0x00.
   After that, the server sends the response to the client as Response
   #2.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Response #2, the client considers 0x78 and 0x42 as the new
   Sender ID and Recipient ID to use with the server, respectively.  As
   shown in the example, the client practically installs a new OSCORE
   Security Context CTX_B where: i) its Sender ID and Recipient ID are
   0x78 and 0x42, respectively; ii) the Sender Sequence Number and the
   Replay Window are re-initialized (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]);
   iii) anything else is like in the OSCORE Security Context used to
   decrypt the OSCORE response.

   From then on, the client and the server can exchange messages
   protected with the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B, i.e., according to
   the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs and using new keying material
   derived from those.

   That is, the client sends the OSCORE message Request #3, which is
   protected with CTX_B and specifies the new client's Sender ID 0x78 in
   the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.

   Upon receiving the OSCORE message Request #3, the server retrieves
   the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B, according to its new Recipient ID
   0x78 specified in the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.  Then, the
   server decrypts and verifies the response by using CTX_B.  Finally,
   the server prepares a CoAP response, protects it with CTX_B, and
   sends it to the client as Response #3.

   Upon receiving the OSCORE message Response #3, the client decrypts
   and verifies it with the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B.  In case of
   successfull verification, the client confirms that the server is
   aligned with the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, and thus discards
   the OSCORE Security Context CTX_A.

   After that, one further exchange occurs, where both the CoAP request
   and the CoAP response are protected with the OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_B.  In particular, upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully
   verifying the OSCORE message Request #4, the server confirms that the
   client is aligned with the new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, and thus
   discards the OSCORE Security Context CTX_A.

2.1.3.  Additional Actions for Execution

   After having experienced a loss of state, a peer MUST NOT participate
   in a stand-alone OSCORE IDs update procedure with another peer, until
   having performed a full-fledged establishment/renewal of an OSCORE
   Security Context with the other peer (e.g., by running KUDOS
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] or the EDHOC protocol
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]).

   More precisely, a peer has experienced a loss of state if it cannot
   access the latest snapshot of the latest OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_OLD or the whole set of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that have
   been used with the triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context)
   of CTX_OLD.  This can happen, for instance, after a device reboot.

   Furthermore, when participating in a stand-alone OSCORE IDs update
   procedure, a peer performs the following additional steps.

   *  When a peer sends an OSCORE IDs update message, the value of the
      Recipient-ID Option that the peer specifies as its new intended
      OSCORE Recipient ID MUST fulfill both the following conditions: it
      is currently available as Recipient ID to use for the peer (see
      Section 3.3 of [RFC8613]); and the peer has never used it as
      Recipient ID with the current triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt,
      ID Context).

   *  When receiving an OSCORE IDs update message, the peer MUST abort
      the procedure if it has already used the identifier specified in
      the Recipient-ID Option as its own Sender ID with the current
      triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context).

   In order to fulfill the conditions above, a peer has to keep track of
   the OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that it has used with the current
   triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context) since the latest
   update of the OSCORE Master Secret (e.g., performed by running
   KUDOS).

2.2.  Preserving Observations Across ID Updates

   When running the OSCORE IDs Update procedure stand-alone or
   integrated in an execution of KUDOS, the following holds if Observe
   [RFC7641] is supported, in order to preserve ongoing observations
   beyond a change of OSCORE identifiers.

   *  If a peer intends to keep active beyond an update of its Sender ID
      the observations where it is acting as CoAP client, then the peer:

      -  MUST store the value of the 'kid' parameter from the original
         Observe requests, and retain it for the whole duration of the
         observations, throughout which the client MUST NOT update the
         stored value associated with the corresponding Observe
         registration request; and

      -  MUST use the stored value of the 'kid' parameter from the
         original Observe registration request as value for the
         'request_kid' parameter in the external_aad structure (see
         Section 5.4 of [RFC8613]), when verifying notifications for
         that observation as per Section 8.4.2 of [RFC8613].

   *  If a peer is acting as CoAP server in an ongoing observation, then
      the peer:

      -  MUST store the value of the 'kid' parameter from the original
         Observe registration request, and retain it for the whole
         duration of the observation, throughout which the peer MUST NOT
         update the stored value associated with the corresponding
         Observe registration request; and

      -  MUST use the stored value of the 'kid' parameter from the
         original Observe registration request as value for the
         'request_kid' parameter in the external_aad structure (see
         Section 5.4 of [RFC8613]), when protecting notifications for
         that observation as per Section 8.3.1 of [RFC8613].

Appendix A.  Examples of OSCORE ID Updates Integrated in KUDOS

   The following section shows two examples where the ID update
   procedure is performed together with the KUDOS procedure for updating
   OSCORE keying material.

A.1.  Forward Message Flow

   Figure 4 provides an example of the OSCORE IDs update procedure, as
   run integrated in an execution of KUDOS and in the forward message
   flow (see Section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]).  On
   each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID and Recipient ID
   of that peer, respectively.

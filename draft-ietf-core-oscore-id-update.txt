                      Identifier Update for OSCORE
                draft-ietf-core-oscore-id-update-latest

Abstract

   Two peers that communicate with the CoAP protocol can use the Object
   Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) protocol to
   protect their message exchanges end-to-end.  To this end, the two
   peers share an OSCORE Security Context and a number of related
   identifiers.  In particular, each of the two peers stores a Sender ID
   that identifies its own Sender Context within the Security Context,
   and a Recipient ID that identifies the Recipient Context associated
   with the other peer within the same Security Context.  These
   identifiers are sent in plaintext within OSCORE-protected messages.
   Hence, they can be used to correlate messages exchanged between peers
   and track those peers, with consequent privacy implications.  This
   document defines an OSCORE ID update procedure that two peers can use
   to update their OSCORE identifiers.  This procedure can be run stand-
   alone or seamlessly integrated in an execution of the Key Update for
   OSCORE (KUDOS) procedure.

1.  Introduction

   When using the CoAP protocol [RFC7252], two peers can use the Object
   Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) protocol to
   protect their message exchanges end-to-end.  To this end, the two
   peers share an OSCORE Security Context and a number of related
   identifiers.

   As part of the shared Security Context, each peer stores one Sender
   Context identified by a Sender ID and used to protect its outgoing
   messages.  Also, it stores a Recipient Context identified by a
   Recipient ID and used to unprotect the incoming messages from the
   other peer.  That is, one's peer Sender ID (Recipient ID) is equal to
   the other peer's Recipient ID (Sender ID).

   When receiving an OSCORE-protected message, the recipient peer uses
   its Recipient ID conveyed within the message or otherwise implied, in
   order to retrieve the correct Security Context and unprotect the
   message.

   These identifiers are sent in plaintext within OSCORE-protected
   messages and are immutable throughout the lifetime of a Security
   Context, even in case the two peers migrate to a different network or
   simply change their addressing information.  Therefore, the
   identifiers can be used to correlate messages that the two peers
   exchange at different points in time or through different paths,
   hence allowing to track them with the consequent privacy
   implications.

   In order to address this issue, this document defines an OSCORE ID
   update procedure that two peers can use to update their OSCORE Sender
   and Recipient IDs.  For instance, two peers may want to use this
   procedure before switching to a different network, in order to make
   it more difficult to understand that their communication is
   continuing in the new network.

   The OSCORE ID update procedure can be run stand-alone or seamlessly
   integrated in an execution of the Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS)
   procedure [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CoAP [RFC7252], Observe [RFC7641], CBOR [RFC8949], OSCORE
   [RFC8613], and KUDOS [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update].

2.  Update of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs

   This section defines the procedure that two peers can perform, in
   order to update the OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that they use in
   their shared OSCORE Security Context.

   When performing an update of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs, a peer
   provides its new intended OSCORE Recipient ID to the other peer, by
   means of the Recipient-ID Option defined in Section 2.3.  Hereafter,
   this document refers to a message including the Recipient-ID Option
   as an "ID update (request/response) message".  Furthermore, a peer
   uses the Recipient-ID-Ack Option to confirm the chosen Recipient ID
   of the other peer.

   This procedure can be initiated by either peer, i.e., the CoAP client
   or the CoAP server may start it by sending the first OSCORE ID update
   message.

   Furthermore, this procedure can be executed stand-alone, or instead
   seamlessly integrated in an execution of the KUDOS procedure for
   updating OSCORE keying material used in its FS mode (see Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]) or no-FS mode (see Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]).

   *  In the former stand-alone case, updating the OSCORE Sender/
      Recipient IDs effectively results in updating part of the current
      OSCORE Security Context.

      That is, both peers derive a new Sender Key, Recipient Key, and
      Common IV, as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC8613].  Also, both
      peers re-initialize the Sender Sequence Number and the Replay
      Window accordingly, as defined in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613].
      Since the same Master Secret is preserved, forward secrecy is not
      achieved.

      As defined in Section 2.4.3, the two peers must take additional
      actions to ensure a safe execution of the OSCORE ID update
      procedure.

      The new OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs MUST NOT be used with the
      OSCORE Security Context CTX_OLD, and MUST NOT be used with the
      temporary OSCORE Security Context CTX_TEMP used to protect the
      first KUDOS message of a KUDOS execution.

   A peer MUST NOT initiate an OSCORE ID update procedure with another
   peer, if it has another such procedure ongoing with that other peer.

   Upon receiving a valid, first ID update message, a peer MUST continue
   the procedure and send a following ID update message, except in the
   case any of the conditions for failing or aborting the procedure
   apply (see Section 2.2}).

2.1.  Workflow of the ID Update Procedure

   This section describes the workflow of the OSCORE ID Update procedure
   in detail.

   The procedure begins when either peer:

   *  Sends a message including the Recipient-ID Option, or

   *  Receives such a message from the other peer.

   During the procedure a peer decides on a value of Recipient ID to
   offer to the other peer and use as value of the Recipient-ID Option,
   and continues offering that value until the procedure is completed.

   Once the procedure has started a peer shall follow the instructions
   below:

   *Sending the Next Message*

   *  The first messages sent using CTX_A, the current shared OSCORE
      Security Context, after the procedure has started must include the
      Recipient-ID Option, if this peer hasn't offered its Recipient ID
      already.

      -  Note that this also informs the other peer of support for the
         ID update procedure.

   *Acknowledgment*

   *  If a peer has received a valid message from the other peer
      including the Recipient-ID Option, it must include the Recipient-
      ID-Ack Option in subsequent messages.

   *  The value of Recipient-ID-Ack Option, if used, should be the
      Recipient ID received from the other peer.

   *Sending Subsequent Messages*

   A peer must send one message with the Recipient ID Option according
   to the following:

   *  A local timer, REPEAT_TIMER, should be maintained during the
      procedure.  It first starts when the procedure starts.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that the initial time of REPEAT_TIMER is equal to
      MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT (see Section 4.8.2 of [RFC7252]).

      -  If the timeout expires, the next sent message must include the
         Recipient ID option and, if applicable, the Recipient-ID-Ack
         Option with the last received Recipient ID.  When that message
         is sent the timer REPEAT_TIMER restarts.

2.1.1.  Procedure Completion

   The procedure concludes under one of the following conditions:

   *Successful Confirmation*

   The procedure succeeds if a peer has received and successfully
   verified at least three message from the other peer containing the
   Recipient-ID-Ack Option, and sent at least two messages containing
   the Recipient-ID-Ack Option.  At this point:

   *  It is safe to delete CTX_A.  This does not mean that CTX_A has to
      be deleted at this point.

   *  CTX_B is now considered valid and can be used (e.g., following
      network migration).

   *Failure*

   During the procedure a timer, ENDING_TIMER, is maintained and started
   when the procedure starts.  The initial time of ENDING_TIMER should
   be at least 3 times bigger than the initial time of REPEAT_TIMER.  If
   the ENDING_TIMER expires, and the procedure times out without
   confirmation:

   *  The offered Recipient ID must be discarded and added to the list
      of IDs to prevent reuse.

2.2.  Failure of the ID Update Procedure

   The following section describes cases where the OSCORE ID update
   procedure fails, or must to be aborted by one of the peers.

   Upon receiving a valid first ID update message, a peer MUST abort the
   ID update procedure, in the following case:

   *  The received ID update message is not a KUDOS message (i.e., the
      OSCORE ID update procedure is being performed stand-alone) and the
      peer has no eligible Recipient ID to offer (see Section 2.4.3).

   Upon receiving a valid ID update message, a peer MUST abort the ID
   update procedure, in the following case:

   *  The received ID update message contains a Recipient-ID option with
      a length that exceeds the maximum length of OSCORE Sender/
      Recipient IDs for the AEAD algorithm in use for the OSCORE
      Security Context shared between the peers.  This is the case when
      the length of the Recipient-ID option exceeds the length of the
      AEAD nonce minus 6 (see Section 3.3 of [RFC8613]).

   If, after receiving an ID update message as CoAP request, a peer
   aborts the ID update procedure, the peer MUST also reply to the
   received ID update request message with a protected 5.03 (Service
   Unavailable) error response.  The error response MUST NOT include the
   Recipient-ID Option, and its diagnostic payload MAY provide
   additional information.  When receiving the error response, the peer
   terminates the OSCORE IDs procedure as failed.

   When the OSCORE ID update procedure is integrated into the execution
   of the KUDOS procedure, it is possible that the KUDOS procedure
   succeeds while the OSCORE ID update procedure fails.  In such case,
   the peers continue their communications using the newly derived
   OSCORE Security Context CTX_NEW obtained from the KUDOS procedure,
   and still use the old Sender and Recipient IDs.  That is, any
   Recipient IDs conveyed in the exchanged Recipient-ID Options is not
   considered.

   Conversely, the OSCORE ID update procedure may succeed while the
   KUDOS procedure fails.  As long as the peers have exchanged a pair of
   OSCORE-protected request and response that conveyed their desired new
   Recipient IDs in the Recipient-ID Option, the peers start using those
   IDs in their communications.

2.3.  The Recipient-ID Option

   The Recipient ID-Option defined in this section has the properties
   summarized in Table 1, which extends Table 4 of [RFC7252].  That is,
   the option is elective, safe to forward, part of the cache key, and
   not repeatable.

   +=======+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
   | No.   | C | U | N | R | Name         | Format | Length | Default |
   +=======+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
   | TBD24 |   |   |   |   | Recipient-ID | opaque | any    | (none)  |
   +-------+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+

         Table 1: The Recipient-ID Option.  C=Critical, U=Unsafe,
                        N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable

   Note to RFC Editor: Following the registration of the CoAP Option
   Number 24, please replace "TBD24" with "24" in the figure above.
   Then, please delete this paragraph.

   The option value can have an arbitrary length, including zero length
   to indicate intent to use the empty string as Recipient ID.
   Implementations can limit its length to that of the longest supported
   Recipient ID.

   This document particularly defines how this option is used in
   messages protected with OSCORE.  That is, when the option is included
   in an outgoing message, the option value specifies the new OSCORE
   Recipient ID that the sender endpoint intends to use with the other
   endpoint sharing the OSCORE Security Context.

   Therefore, the maximum length of the option value is equal to the
   maximum length of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs.  As defined in
   Section 3.3 of [RFC8613], this is determined by the size of the AEAD
   nonce of the used AEAD Algorithm in the OSCORE Security Context.

   If the length of the Recipient ID included in the Recipient-ID option
   is zero, the option value SHALL be empty (Option Length = 0).

   The Recipient-ID Option is of class E in terms of OSCORE processing
   (see Section 4.1 of [RFC8613]).

2.4.  The Recipient-ID-Ack Option

   The Recipient ID-Ack-Option defined in this section has the
   properties summarized in Table 2, which extends Table 4 of [RFC7252].
   That is, the option is elective, safe to forward, part of the cache
   key, and not repeatable.

   +=======+=+=+===+===+==================+========+========+=========+
   | No.   |C|U| N | R | Name             | Format | Length | Default |
   +=======+=+=+===+===+==================+========+========+=========+
   | TBD32 | | |   |   | Recipient-ID-Ack | opaque | any    | (none)  |
   +-------+-+-+---+---+------------------+--------+--------+---------+

       Table 2: The Recipient-ID-Ack Option.  C=Critical, U=Unsafe,
                        N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable

   Note to RFC Editor: Following the registration of the CoAP Option
   Number 32, please replace "TBD32" with "32" in the figure above.
   Then, please delete this paragraph.

   This document particularly defines how this option is used in
   messages protected with OSCORE.  That is, when the option is included
   in an outgoing message, the option value confirms the new OSCORE
   Recipient ID that the recipient endpoint has chosen for this sender
   endpoint.

   The Recipient-ID-Ack Option is of class E in terms of OSCORE
   processing (see Section 4.1 of [RFC8613]).

2.4.1.  OSCORE ID Update Procedure Initiated with a Request Message

   Figure 1 shows an example of the OSCORE ID update procedure, run
   stand-alone and initiated by the client sending a request message.
   On each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID and Recipient
   ID of that peer, respectively.  An example where the server initiates
   the procedure is shown in Appendix A.1.

                 Client                             Server

       Figure 1: Example of the OSCORE ID update procedure initiated
                           with a request message

   Before the OSCORE ID update procedure starts, the client (the server)
   shares with the server (the client) an OSCORE Security Context CTX_A
   with Sender ID 0x01 (0x00) and Recipient ID 0x00 (0x01).

   When starting the OSCORE ID update procedure, the client determines
   its new intended OSCORE Recipient ID 0x42.  Then, the client prepares
   a CoAP request targeting an application resource at the server.  The
   request includes the Recipient-ID Option, with value the client's new
   Recipient ID 0x42.

   The client protects the request with CTX_A, i.e., by using the keying
   material derived from the client's current Sender ID 0x01.  The
   protected request specifies the client's current Sender ID 0x01 in
   the 'kid' field of the OSCORE Option.  After that, the client sends
   the request to the server as Request #1.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Request #1, the server retrieves the value 0x42 from the
   Recipient-ID Option, and determines its new intended OSCORE Recipient
   ID 0x78.  Then, the server prepares a CoAP response including the
   Recipient-ID Option, with value the server's new Recipient ID 0x78,
   and the Recipient-ID-Ack Option, with value the client's offered
   Recipient ID 0x42.

   The server protects the response with CTX_A, i.e., by using the
   keying material derived from the server's current Sender ID 0x00.
   After that, the server sends the response to the client.

   Next, the client sends the OSCORE message Request #2, which is
   protected with CTX_A and includes the Recipient-ID-Ack Option, with
   value the server's offered Recipient ID 0x78.

   From this point, following messages exchanges between the peers will
   include the Recipient-ID-Ack Option.  A peer will only stop including
   that option when it has verified 3 messages from the other peer
   containing the Recipient-ID-Ack Option.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Response #3, the client considers 0x78 and 0x42 as the new
   Sender ID and Recipient ID to use when deriving CTX_B.  Practically,
   the client can install a new OSCORE Security Context CTX_B where: i)
   its Sender ID and Recipient ID are 0x78 and 0x42, respectively; ii)
   the Sender Sequence Number and the Replay Window are re-initialized
   (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]); iii) anything else is like in the
   OSCORE Security Context CTX_A.

   Upon receiving, decrypting, and successfully verifying the OSCORE
   message Request #4, the server considers 0x42 and 0x78 as its new
   Sender ID and Recipient ID to use for CTX_B.  Practically, the server
   installs a new OSCORE Security Context CTX_A where: i) its Sender ID
   and Recipient ID are 0x42 and 0x78, respectively; ii) the Sender
   Sequence Number and the Replay Window are re-initialized (see
   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]); iii) anything else is like in the OSCORE
   Security Context CTX_A.

   At this point both client and server are in a position to derive
   CTX_B already, or wait to do it.  Regardless they are both able to
   start using CTX_B, e.g., after network migration.

2.4.2.  Establishing New OSCORE Identifiers Ahead of Network Migration

   Peers may use the OSCORE ID update procedure to establish new OSCORE
   IDs in advance of a network change.  However, peers SHOULD NOT begin
   using these new identifiers on the current network prior to network
   migration.  Using a new identifier on the old network, or using the
   old identifiers on the new network, would allow observers to
   correlate activity across networks, defeating the unlinkability that
   updating the OSCORE IDs is intended to provide.  To be effective, new
   identifiers SHOULD only be used for sending OSCORE protected messages
   once the network migration is completed.  Establishing new OSCORE IDs
   ahead of time ensures that migration can proceed without delay, but
   care must be taken to ensure that premature use of the identifiers
   does not enable linkability.

   To accomplish this, the peers execute the ID update procedure as
   normal, with the following difference: the peers must not begin using
   the OSCORE Security Context CTX_B until after the network migration
   has taken place.  Thus, both peers will be in the position to derive
   CTX_B, but will not transition to use it until the first request
   protected with CTX_B is transmitted in the new network, that is after
   network migration.  Note that peers may want to retain CTX_A to have
   available for migration back to the old network.

2.4.3.  Additional Actions for Execution

   After having experienced a loss of state, a peer MUST NOT participate
   in a stand-alone OSCORE ID update procedure with another peer, until
   having performed a full-fledged establishment/renewal of an OSCORE
   Security Context with the other peer (e.g., by running KUDOS
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] or the authenticated key
   establishment protocol EDHOC [RFC9528]).

   More precisely, a peer has experienced a loss of state if it cannot
   access the latest snapshot of the latest OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_OLD or the whole set of OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that have
   been used with the triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context)
   of CTX_OLD.  This can happen, for instance, after a device reboots.

   Furthermore, when participating in a stand-alone OSCORE ID update
   procedure, a peer performs the following additional steps.

   *  When a peer sends an ID update message, the value of the
      Recipient-ID Option that the peer specifies as its new intended
      OSCORE Recipient ID MUST fulfill both the following conditions: it
      is currently available as Recipient ID to use for the peer (see
      Section 3.3 of [RFC8613]); and the peer has never used it as
      Recipient ID with the current triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt,
      ID Context).

   *  When receiving an ID update message, the peer MUST abort the
      procedure if it has already used the identifier specified in the
      Recipient-ID Option as its own Sender ID with the current triplet
      (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context).

   In order to fulfill the conditions above, a peer has to keep track of
   the OSCORE Sender/Recipient IDs that it has used with the current
   triplet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context) since the latest
   update of the OSCORE Master Secret (e.g., performed by running
   KUDOS).

2.5.  Preserving Observations Across ID Updates

   When having run the OSCORE ID update procedure stand-alone and
   starting to use CTX_B, or having run the OSCORE ID update procedure
   integrated in an execution of KUDOS, the following holds if Observe
   [RFC7641] is supported, in order to preserve ongoing observations
   beyond a change of OSCORE identifiers.

   *  If a peer intends to keep active beyond an update of its Sender ID
      the observations where it is acting as CoAP client, then the peer:

      -  MUST store the value of the 'kid' parameter from the original
         Observe requests, and retain it for the whole duration of the
         observations, throughout which the client MUST NOT update the
         stored value associated with the corresponding Observe
         registration request; and

      -  MUST use the stored value of the 'kid' parameter from the
         original Observe registration request as value for the
         'request_kid' parameter in the external_aad structure (see
         Section 5.4 of [RFC8613]), when verifying notifications for
         that observation as per Section 8.4.2 of [RFC8613].

   *  If a peer is acting as CoAP server in an ongoing observation, then
      the peer:

      -  MUST store the value of the 'kid' parameter from the original
         Observe registration request, and retain it for the whole
         duration of the observation, throughout which the peer MUST NOT
         update the stored value associated with the corresponding
         Observe registration request; and

      -  MUST use the stored value of the 'kid' parameter from the
         original Observe registration request as value for the
         'request_kid' parameter in the external_aad structure (see
         Section 5.4 of [RFC8613]), when protecting notifications for
         that observation as per Section 8.3.1 of [RFC8613].

3.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as in [RFC8613] and
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] hold for this document.

   The OSCORE ID update procedure is a mechanism to mitigate the risk of
   tracking by on-path adversaries.  By enabling endpoints to update
   their identifiers, either in response to specific events or on a
   regular basis, this approach helps prevent correlations that could
   otherwise be drawn between OSCORE messages on different networks.

   While the ID update procedure helps reduce linkability across
   networks, the change of IDs alone might not completely prevent
   adversaries from recognizing traffic patterns that reveal message
   ordering or frequency.  That is, the procedure becomes more effective
   if combined with the protection and/or change of other information
   that can help identify endpoints across different networks.

   In that spirit, when a peer installs a new OSCORE Security Context as
   a result of the OSCORE ID update procedure, it re-initializes the
   Sender Sequence Number to 0.  That prevents an adversary from
   obviously tracking the peer by leveraging the Partial IV of observed
   messages, since the Partial IV value does not predictably continue
   from the last known value that was used in the previous network.
   Building on that, the peer can in fact re-initialize the Sender
   Sequence Number to a value greater than 0, thus making tracking
   further difficult.

   Likewise, other information such as addressing information, may still
   be used to track the peers.  Thus, it is recommended to combine the
   usage of the OSCORE ID update procedure also with the following, upon
   network migration:

   *  Changing the network address (e.g., intentionally, or due to
      mobility, or NAT rebinding).

   *  Changing the link-layer address (e.g., MAC address randomization).

   Furthermore, it is recommended that a peer does not start using its
   newly established OSCORE Sender ID until after network migration, in
   order to mitigate tracking attempts.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This appendix provides examples where the OSCORE ID update procedure
   is used.  In particular:

   *  Appendix A.1 shows an example of the OSCORE ID update procedure
      initiated by the server sending a response message.

   *  Appendix A.2 shows an example of the OSCORE ID update procedure
      initiated by the client sending a request message where the
      procedure fails to complete.

A.1.  OSCORE ID Update Procedure Initiated with a Response Message

   Figure 2 shows an example of the OSCORE ID update procedure, run
   stand-alone and initiated by the server sending a response message.
   On each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID and Recipient
   ID of that peer, respectively.  The prerequisites and the actions

       Figure 2: Example of the OSCORE ID update procedure initiated
                          with a response message

A.2.  Failure of the OSCORE ID Update Procedure Initiated with a Request
      Message

   Figure 3 shows an example of the OSCORE ID update procedure, run
   stand-alone and initiated by the client sending a request message
   where the procedure fails to complete due to the server not including
   the Recipient-ID-Ack option or the Recipient-ID in its response
   messages.  On each peer, SID and RID denote the OSCORE Sender ID and
   Recipient ID of that peer, respectively.  This example assumes that
   the value of the REPEAT_TIMER on the client is such that it expires
   between each request the client sends.

   The client repeatedly tries sending requests to the client including
   the Recipient-ID option, but does not receive acknowledgments in the
   form of responses containing the Response-ID-Ack option from the
   server.  Thus the client eventually reaches the expiration of its
   ENDING_TIMER, aborts the OSCORE ID update procedure, and proceeds to
   continue communication with normal OSCORE messages.
